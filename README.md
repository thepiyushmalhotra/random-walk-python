# random-walk-python

## A Simple Program to display the workings of random walk algorithm using Python and its Turtle module. 
Remember that old Windows screensaver where a bunch of pipes would move in a random and highly unpredictive motion? That is known as the ***Random Walk Algorithm*** and this basic program is created to just display how this algorithm works. 
The turtle module is used with Python for visual GUI purposes. The color palette is defined through a Python List, mainly because of visual purposes so that it looks aesthetically more pleasing and consistent. It can be altered to display completely random colors using a function that generates random RGB colors. For example:

    def random_color():  
        R = random.randint(0,255)  
        G = random.randint(0,255)  
        B = random.randint(0,255)  
        yertle.color(R,G,B)
