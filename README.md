## A Simple Program to display the workings of random walk algorithm using Python and its Turtle module. 
A highly basic program which is created to just display how the "random walk" algorithm works. The turtle module is used in line with Python for visual GUI purposes. The color palette is defined through a Python "List", mainly because of visual purposes so that it looks aesthetically more pleasing and consistent. It can be altered to display completely random colors using a function that generates random RGB colors.
